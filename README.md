Repo for the development of the Gen5X open hardware generatively designed 5 axis 3D printer. 

Imagine a world where machines not only have the ability to design and manufacture products, but they can also create their own updates and upgrades, without any human intervention. The Gen5X is an open-source project aiming to develop self-designing, rapid replicating machines. This repo aims to serve as a resource for researchers in the fields of computational design, AM, and Mechanical Engineering. By open-sourcing this project we hope to foster innovation within the community, and invite you to join us in pushing the boundaries of what is possible with generative design, 3D printing technology, and AI.Â
