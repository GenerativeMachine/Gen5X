# Gen5X
Repo for the development of the Gen5X open hardware generatively designed 5 axis 3D printer. 

The Open-Source Generative 5-Axis 3D Printer is a novel approach to the design and fabrication of three-dimensional objects. This project aims to combine the power of generative algorithms with the precision and versatility of 5-axis printing technology to produce unique and complex geometries. The printer is open-source, allowing for the free access and modification of the design and code by any interested party.

The utilization of generative design techniques presents an opportunity to explore the realm of possibilities in terms of the shapes and forms that can be produced. Furthermore, the implementation of 5-axis printing expands the range of printing orientations and increases the precision in the fabrication process.

This project serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of computational design, additive manufacturing, and engineering. The open-source nature of the project encourages collaboration and fosters innovation within the community. We invite you to join us in pushing the boundaries of what is possible with 3D printing technology.
